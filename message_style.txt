Follow conventional commit format:
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the first line concise (50 chars or less)
- Start with a type prefix: feat:, fix:, docs:, style:, refactor:, test:, chore:
- If needed, add a more detailed explanation after a blank line

Examples:
feat: Add user authentication with OAuth2
fix: Resolve memory leak in data processing
docs: Update API documentation for v2
refactor: Simplify validation logic
